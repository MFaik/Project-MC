# Project MC
Have fun!<br>


This game may never be finished so don't get your hopes up.<br>
Edit: It won't be finished but I might rewrite this when I feel like it and give up again

Project MC is just a shitty text editor, <br>
I had a lot of plans for this to be a game but as I always do I left this project to rot

The code wasn't tested with windows, linux ,mac or any other cool OS you might be using.<br>
Any issues with sth other than windows may take longer to fix because of that.(lol do you really think I will push updates to this crap)

Made by me a.k.a. Pro Tetris Masterâ„¢ a.k.a. Cactie<br>
This is a side project of my side project wich was a side project of my main project
Edit: All of those projects died so yeah... I hope I can get into university

To compile the code you just need g++<br>
(the version I use is 7.3.0 so I dunno if other versions work or not)

**insert legal stuff here cause I dont really understand how they work**<br>
OwO UwU OwO
