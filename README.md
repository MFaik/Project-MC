# Project MC
Have fun!<br>


This game may never be finished so don't get your hopes up.

Project MC is game that was inspired by minecraft mods.<br>
TL;DR I just wanted to make computer craft mod the game.

The code wasn't tested with linux ,mac or any other cool OS you might be using.<br>
Any issues with sth other than windows may take longer to fix because of that.

Made by me a.k.a. Pro Tetris Masterâ„¢<br>
This is a side project of my side project wich was a side project of my main project

To compile the code you just need g++<br>
(the version I use is 7.3.0 so I dunno if other versions work or not)

**insert legal stuff here cause I dont really understand how they work**<br>
OwO UwU OwO
